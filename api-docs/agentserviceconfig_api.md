# AgentServiceConfig API

## Spec Fields

AgentServiceConfigSpec defines the desired state of AgentServiceConfig.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **OSImageAdditionalParamsRef** | `object` | OSImageAdditionalParamsRef is a reference to a secret containing a headers and query parameters to be used during OS image fetch. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names TODO: Add other useful fields. apiVersion, kind, uid? | N/A |
|  **OSImageCACertRef** | `object` | OSImageCACertRef is a reference to a config map containing a certificate authority certificate this is an optional certificate to allow a user to add a certificate authority for a HTTPS source of images this certificate will be used by the assisted-image-service when pulling OS images. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names TODO: Add other useful fields. apiVersion, kind, uid? | N/A |
|  **databaseStorage** | `object` | DatabaseStorage defines the spec of the PersistentVolumeClaim to be created for the database's filesystem. With respect to the resource requests, minimum 10GiB is recommended. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **accessModes** | `array` | accessModes contains the desired access modes the volume should have. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1 | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **dataSource** | `object` | dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef, and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified. If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiGroup** | `string` | APIGroup is the group for the resource being referenced. If APIGroup is not specified, the specified Kind must be in the core API group. For any other third-party types, APIGroup is required. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind is the type of resource being referenced | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name is the name of resource being referenced | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **dataSourceRef** | `object` | dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in any namespaces.

See the ReferenceGrant documentation for details. (Alpha) This field requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resources** | `object` | resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have.

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchLabels** | `object` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs.

An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set. If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists. If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists.
