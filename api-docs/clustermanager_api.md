# ClusterManager API

ClusterManager configures the controllers on the hub that govern registration and work distribution for attached Klusterlets.
In Default mode, ClusterManager will only be deployed in open-cluster-management-hub namespace.
In Hosted mode, ClusterManager will be deployed in the namespace with the same name as cluster manager.

## Spec Fields

Spec represents a desired deployment configuration of controllers that govern registration and work distribution for attached Klusterlets.
