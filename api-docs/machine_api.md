# Machine API

Machine is the Schema for the machines API.
Deprecated: This type will be removed in one of the next releases.

## Spec Fields

spec is the desired state of Machine.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **bootstrap** | `object` | bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **configRef** | `object` | configRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.Data without the need of a controller. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **uid** | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **data** | `string` | data contains the bootstrap data, such as cloud-init details scripts. If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state. Deprecated: Switch to DataSecretName. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **dataSecretName** | `string` | dataSecretName is the name of the secret that stores the bootstrap data script. If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state. | N/A |
|  **clusterName** | `string` | clusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to. | N/A |
|  **failureDomain** | `string` | failureDomain is the failure domain the machine will be created in. Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object. | N/A |
|  **infrastructureRef** | `object` | infrastructureRef is a required reference to a custom resource offered by an infrastructure provider. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **uid** | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids | N/A |
|  **nodeDrainTimeout** | `string` | nodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node. The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations. NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout` | N/A |
|  **providerID** | `string` | providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider. This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider. | N/A |
|  **version** | `string` | version defines the desired Kubernetes version. This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers. | N/A |
## Status Fields

status is the observed state of Machine.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **addresses** | `array` | addresses is a list of addresses assigned to the machine. This field is copied from the infrastructure provider reference. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **address** | `string` | address is the machine address. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | type is the machine address type, one of Hostname, ExternalIP or InternalIP. | N/A |
|  **bootstrapReady** | `boolean` | bootstrapReady is the state of the bootstrap provider. | N/A |
|  **conditions** | `array` | conditions defines current service state of the Machine. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastTransitionTime** | `string` | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **message** | `string` | message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This field may be empty. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | reason is the reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may not be empty. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **severity** | `string` | severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately understand the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. | N/A |
|  **failureMessage** | `string` | failureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the Machine and will contain a more verbose string suitable for logging and human consumption. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
|  **failureReason** | `string` | failureReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the Machine and will contain a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
|  **infrastructureReady** | `boolean` | infrastructureReady is the state of the infrastructure provider. | N/A |
|  **lastUpdated** | `string` | lastUpdated identifies when the phase of the Machine last transitioned. | N/A |
|  **nodeRef** | `object` | nodeRef will point to the corresponding Node if it exists. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **uid** | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids | N/A |
|  **observedGeneration** | `integer` | observedGeneration is the latest generation observed by the controller. | N/A |
|  **phase** | `string` | phase represents the current phase of machine actuation. E.g. Pending, Running, Terminating, Failed etc. | N/A |
|  **version** | `string` | version specifies the current version of Kubernetes running on the corresponding Node. This is meant to be a means of bubbling up status from the Node to the Machine. It is entirely optional, but useful for end-user UX if it’s present. | N/A |
