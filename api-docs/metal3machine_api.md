# Metal3Machine API

## Spec Fields

Metal3MachineSpec defines the desired state of Metal3Machine.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **automatedCleaningMode** | `string` | When set to disabled, automated cleaning of host disks will be skipped during provisioning and deprovisioning. | N/A |
|  **customDeploy** | `object` | A custom deploy procedure. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **method** | `string` | Custom deploy method name. This name is specific to the deploy ramdisk used. If you don't have a custom deploy ramdisk, you shouldn't use CustomDeploy. | N/A |
|  **dataTemplate** | `object` | MetadataTemplate is a reference to a Metal3DataTemplate object containing a template of metadata to be rendered. Metadata keys defined in the metadataTemplate take precedence over keys defined in metadata field. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod).

## Status Fields

Metal3MachineStatus defines the observed state of Metal3Machine.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **addresses** | `array` | Addresses is a list of addresses assigned to the machine. This field is copied from the infrastructure provider reference. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **address** | `string` | The machine address. | N/A |

|  **conditions** | `array` | Conditions defines current service state of the Metal3Machine. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastTransitionTime** | `string` | Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **message** | `string` | A human readable message indicating details about the transition. This field may be empty. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may be empty. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **severity** | `string` | severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately understand the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. | N/A |
|  **failureMessage** | `string` | FailureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the metal3machine and will contain a more verbose string suitable for logging and human consumption. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the metal3machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of metal3machines can be added as events to the metal3machine object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
|  **failureReason** | `string` | FailureReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the metal3machine and will contain a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the metal3machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of metal3machines can be added as events to the metal3machine object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
|  **lastUpdated** | `string` | LastUpdated identifies when this status was last observed. | N/A |
