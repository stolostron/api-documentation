# Advanced Cluster Management Custom Resource API Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) used in this project.

## ManagedClusterView

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedClusterView](managedclusterview_api.md).

---

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedServiceAccount](managedserviceaccount_api.md).

---

[View a detailed API Reference for ClusterCurator](clustercurator_api.md).

---

## ClusterManager

ClusterManager configures the controllers on the hub that govern registration and work distribution for attached Klusterlets.
In Default mode, ClusterManager will only be deployed in open-cluster-management-hub namespace.
In Hosted mode, ClusterManager will be deployed in the namespace with the same name as cluster manager.

[View a detailed API Reference for ClusterManager](clustermanager_api.md).

---

## AddOnTemplate

AddOnTemplate is the Custom Resource object, it is used to describe
how to deploy the addon agent and how to register the addon.
AddOnTemplate is a cluster-scoped resource, and will only be used
on the hub cluster.

[View a detailed API Reference for AddOnTemplate](addontemplate_api.md).

---

## Placement

Placement defines a rule to select a set of ManagedClusters from the ManagedClusterSets bound
to the placement namespace.
Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching
list of ManagedClusters:
 1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters;
 2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets;
 3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces;
 4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set
    of potential ManagedClusters;
 5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection.
A ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement
namespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a
ManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual
subresource of `managedclustersets/bind`.
A slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}
will be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement.
If a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may
apply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on
this ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.

[View a detailed API Reference for Placement](placement_api.md).

---

## ManagedClusterAddOn

ManagedClusterAddOn is the Custom Resource object which holds the current state
of an add-on. This object is used by add-on operators to convey their state.
This resource should be created in the ManagedCluster namespace.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedClusterAddOn](managedclusteraddon_api.md).

---

## AddOnDeploymentConfig

AddOnDeploymentConfig represents a configuration to customize the deployments of an add-on.
For example, you can specify the NodePlacement to control the scheduling of the add-on agents.

[View a detailed API Reference for AddOnDeploymentConfig](addondeploymentconfig_api.md).

---

## AddOnPlacementScore

AddOnPlacementScore represents a bundle of scores of one managed cluster, which could be used by placement.
AddOnPlacementScore is a namespace scoped resource. The namespace of the resource is the cluster namespace.

[View a detailed API Reference for AddOnPlacementScore](addonplacementscore_api.md).

---

## PlacementDecision

PlacementDecision indicates a decision from a placement.
PlacementDecision must have a cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name} label to reference a certain placement.
If a placement has spec.numberOfClusters specified, the total number of decisions contained in
the status.decisions of PlacementDecisions must be the same as NumberOfClusters. Otherwise, the
total number of decisions must equal the number of ManagedClusters that
match the placement requirements.
Some of the decisions might be empty when there are not enough ManagedClusters to meet the placement requirements.

[View a detailed API Reference for PlacementDecision](placementdecision_api.md).

---

## ManifestWork

ManifestWork represents a manifests workload that hub wants to deploy on the managed cluster.
A manifest workload is defined as a set of Kubernetes resources.
ManifestWork must be created in the cluster namespace on the hub, so that agent on the
corresponding managed cluster can access this resource and deploy on the managed
cluster.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManifestWork](manifestwork_api.md).

---

## ManagedClusterSet

ManagedClusterSet defines a group of ManagedClusters that you can run
workloads on. You can define a workload to be deployed on a ManagedClusterSet. See the following options  for the workload:
- The workload can run on any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet
- The workload cannot run on any ManagedCluster outside the ManagedClusterSet
- The service exposed by the workload can be shared in any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet
To assign a ManagedCluster to a certain ManagedClusterSet, add a label with the name cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset
on the ManagedCluster to refer to the ManagedClusterSet. You are not
allowed to add or remove this label on a ManagedCluster unless you have an
RBAC rule to CREATE on a virtual subresource of managedclustersets/join.
To update this label, you must have the permission on both
the old and new ManagedClusterSet.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedClusterSet](managedclusterset_api.md).

---

## ManagedClusterSetBinding

ManagedClusterSetBinding projects a ManagedClusterSet into a certain namespace.
You can create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace and bind it to a
ManagedClusterSet if both have a RBAC rules to CREATE on the virtual subresource of managedclustersets/bind.
Workloads that you create in the same namespace can only be distributed to ManagedClusters
in ManagedClusterSets that are bound in this namespace by higher-level controllers.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedClusterSetBinding](managedclustersetbinding_api.md).

---

## ManagedCluster

ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status
of a managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster-scoped resource. The name
is the cluster UID.
The cluster join process is a double opt-in process. See the following join process steps:
1. The agent on the managed cluster creates a CSR on the hub with the cluster UID and agent name.
2. The agent on the managed cluster creates a ManagedCluster on the hub.
3. The cluster admin on the hub cluster approves the CSR for the UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster.
4. The cluster admin sets the spec.acceptClient of the ManagedCluster to true.
5. The cluster admin on the managed cluster creates a credential of the kubeconfig for the hub cluster.
After the hub cluster creates the cluster namespace, the klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes
the credential to the hub cluster to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManagedCluster](managedcluster_api.md).

---

## ManifestWorkReplicaSet

ManifestWorkReplicaSet is the Schema for the ManifestWorkReplicaSet API. This custom resource is able to apply
ManifestWork using Placement for 0..n ManagedCluster(in their namespaces). It will also remove the ManifestWork custom resources
when deleted. Lastly the specific ManifestWork custom resources created per ManagedCluster namespace will be adjusted based on PlacementDecision
changes.

[View a detailed API Reference for ManifestWorkReplicaSet](manifestworkreplicaset_api.md).

---

## ClusterManagementAddOn

ClusterManagementAddOn represents the registration of an add-on to the cluster manager.
This resource allows you to discover which add-ons are available for the cluster manager
and provides metadata information about the add-ons. The ClusterManagementAddOn name is used
for the namespace-scoped ManagedClusterAddOn resource.
