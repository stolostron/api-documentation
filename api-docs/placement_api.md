# Placement API

Placement defines a rule to select a set of ManagedClusters from the ManagedClusterSets bound
to the placement namespace.
Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching
list of ManagedClusters:
 1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters;
 2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets;
 3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces;
 4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set
    of potential ManagedClusters;
 5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection.
A ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement
namespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a
ManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual
subresource of `managedclustersets/bind`.
A slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}
will be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement.
If a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may
apply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on
this ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.

## Spec Fields

Spec defines the attributes of Placement.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **clusterSets** | `array` | ClusterSets represent the ManagedClusterSets from which the ManagedClusters are selected. If the slice is empty, ManagedClusters will be selected from the ManagedClusterSets bound to the placement namespace, otherwise ManagedClusters will be selected from the intersection of this slice and the ManagedClusterSets bound to the placement namespace. | N/A |
|  **decisionStrategy** | `object` | DecisionStrategy divide the created placement decision to groups and define number of clusters per decision group. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **groupStrategy** | `object` | GroupStrategy define strategies to divide selected clusters to decision groups. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **clustersPerDecisionGroup** | `N/A` | ClustersPerDecisionGroup is a specific number or percentage of the total selected clusters. The specific number will divide the placementDecisions to decisionGroups each group has max number of clusters equal to that specific number. The percentage will divide the placementDecisions to decisionGroups each group has max number of clusters based on the total num of selected clusters and percentage. ex; for a total 100 clusters selected, ClustersPerDecisionGroup equal to 20% will divide the placement decision to 5 groups each group should have 20 clusters. Default is having all clusters in a single group. The predefined decisionGroups is expected to be a subset of the selected clusters and the number of items in each group SHOULD be less than ClustersPerDecisionGroup. Once the number of items exceeds the ClustersPerDecisionGroup, the decisionGroups will also be be divided into multiple decisionGroups with same GroupName but different GroupIndex. | `Pattern=^((100\|[1-9][0-9]{0,1})%\|[1-9][0-9]*)$` |

Each prioritizer will calculate an integer score of a cluster in the range of [-100, 100]. The final score of a cluster will be sum(weight * prioritizer_score). A higher weight indicates that the prioritizer weights more in the cluster selection, while 0 weight indicates that the prioritizer is disabled. A negative weight indicates wants to select the last ones. | `Minimum=-10`<br>`Maximum=10` |

In Additive mode, any prioritizer not explicitly enumerated is enabled in its default Configurations, in which Steady and Balance prioritizers have the weight of 1 while other prioritizers have the weight of 0. Additive doesn't require configuring all prioritizers. The default Configurations may change in the future, and additional prioritization will happen. In Exact mode, any prioritizer not explicitly enumerated is weighted as zero. Exact requires knowing the full set of prioritizers you want, but avoids behavior changes between releases. | N/A |

Skew is the maximum difference between the number of selected ManagedClusters in a topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of selected ManagedClusters for the topologies within the same TopologyKey.

It could be DoNotSchedule or ScheduleAnyway. The default value is ScheduleAnyway. DoNotSchedule instructs the scheduler not to schedule more ManagedClusters when MaxSkew is not satisfied. ScheduleAnyway instructs the scheduler to keep scheduling even if MaxSkew is not satisfied. | N/A |
|  **tolerations** | `array` | Tolerations are applied to placements, and allow (but do not require) the managed clusters with certain taints to be selected by placements with matching tolerations. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **effect** | `string` | Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSelect, PreferNoSelect and NoSelectIfNew. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **key** | `string` | Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys. | `Pattern=^([a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*/)?(([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9])$` |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **operator** | `string` | Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a placement can tolerate all taints of a particular category. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **tolerationSeconds** | `integer` | TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoSelect/PreferNoSelect, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. The default value is nil, which indicates it tolerates the taint forever. The start time of counting the TolerationSeconds should be the TimeAdded in Taint, not the cluster scheduled time or TolerationSeconds added time. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **value** | `string` | Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string. | N/A |
