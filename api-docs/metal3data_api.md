# Metal3Data API

Metal3Data is the Schema for the metal3datas API.

## Spec Fields

Metal3DataSpec defines the desired state of Metal3Data.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **claim** | `object` | DataClaim points to the Metal3DataClaim the Metal3Data was created for. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **uid** | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids | N/A |
|  **index** | `integer` | Index stores the index value of this instance in the Metal3DataTemplate. | N/A |
|  **metaData** | `object` | MetaData points to the rendered MetaData secret. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | name is unique within a namespace to reference a secret resource. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | namespace defines the space within which the secret name must be unique. | N/A |
|  **networkData** | `object` | NetworkData points to the rendered NetworkData secret. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | name is unique within a namespace to reference a secret resource. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | namespace defines the space within which the secret name must be unique. | N/A |
|  **template** | `object` | DataTemplate is the Metal3DataTemplate this was generated from. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |

|  **templateReference** | `string` | TemplateReference refers to the Template the Metal3MachineTemplate refers to. It can be matched against the key or it may also point to the name of the template Metal3Data refers to. Deprecated: This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. | N/A |
## Status Fields

Metal3DataStatus defines the observed state of Metal3Data.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **errorMessage** | `string` | ErrorMessage contains the error message | N/A |
|  **ready** | `boolean` | Ready is a flag set to True if the secrets were rendered properly | N/A |
