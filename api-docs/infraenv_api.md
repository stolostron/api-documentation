| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **additionalNTPSources** | `array` | AdditionalNTPSources is a list of NTP sources (hostname or IP) to be added to all cluster hosts. They are added to any NTP sources that were configured through other means. | N/A |
|  **additionalTrustBundle** | `string` | PEM-encoded X.509 certificate bundle. Hosts discovered by this infra-env will trust the certificates in this bundle. Clusters formed from the hosts discovered by this infra-env will also trust the certificates in this bundle. | N/A |
|  **agentLabels** | `object` | AgentLabels lists labels to apply to Agents that are associated with this InfraEnv upon the creation of the Agents. | N/A |
|  **clusterRef** | `object` | ClusterRef is the reference to the single ClusterDeployment that will be installed from this InfraEnv. Future versions will allow for multiple ClusterDeployments and this reference will be removed. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name is unique within a namespace to reference a cluster resource. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace defines the space within which the cluster name must be unique. | N/A |
|  **cpuArchitecture** | `string` | CpuArchitecture specifies the target CPU architecture. Default is x86_64 | N/A |
|  **ignitionConfigOverride** | `string` | Json formatted string containing the user overrides for the initial ignition config | N/A |
|  **imageType** | `string` | ImageType specifies the type of discovery ISO to be generated by the Assisted Installer. Supported values include: - full-iso: A complete Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS) ISO, customized with a specific ignition file. - minimal-iso: A lightweight ISO that retrieves the remainder of the RHCOS root file system (rootfs) dynamically from the Internet | N/A |
|  **ipxeScriptType** | `string` | IPXEScriptType the script type that should be served (DiscoveryImageAlways/BootOrderControl) DiscoveryImageAlways: Boot unconditionaly from the network discovery image BootOrderControl: Boot from discovery ISO depending on the host's state. When the value is BootOrderControl, the service will look for an Agent record that matches the host's MAC address; if found, and if that Agent is in a state where it is provisioned and attached to a cluster, then host will boot the host disk. Otherwise it will boot the discovery ISO using the same script as the DiscoveryImageAlways option. | N/A |
|  **kernelArguments** | `array` | KernelArguments is the additional kernel arguments to be passed during boot time of the discovery image. Applicable for both iPXE, and ISO streaming from Image Service. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **value** | `string` | Value can have the form <parameter> or <parameter>=<value>. The following examples should be supported: rd.net.timeout.carrier=60 isolcpus=1,2,10-20,100-2000:2/25 quiet | `Pattern=^(?:(?:[^ \t\n\r"]+)\|(?:"[^"]*"))+$` |
|  **mirrorRegistryRef** | `object` | MirrorRegistryRef is a reference to a given MirrorRegistry ConfigMap that holds the registries toml data | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchExpressions** | `array` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **key** | `string` | key is the label key that the selector applies to. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **operator** | `string` | operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **values** | `array` | values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchLabels** | `object` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
|  **osImageVersion** | `string` | OSImageVersion is the version of OS image to use when generating the InfraEnv. The version should refer to an OSImage specified in the AgentServiceConfig (i.e. OSImageVersion should equal to an OpenshiftVersion in OSImages list). Note: OSImageVersion can't be specified along with ClusterRef. | N/A |
|  **proxy** | `object` | Proxy defines the proxy settings for agents and clusters that use the InfraEnv. If unset, the agents and clusters will not be configured to use a proxy. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **httpProxy** | `string` | HTTPProxy is the URL of the proxy for HTTP requests. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **httpsProxy** | `string` | HTTPSProxy is the URL of the proxy for HTTPS requests. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **noProxy** | `string` | NoProxy is a comma-separated list of domains and CIDRs for which the proxy should not be used. | N/A |
|  **pullSecretRef** | `object` | PullSecretRef is the reference to the secret to use when pulling images. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names TODO: Add other useful fields. apiVersion, kind, uid? | N/A |
|  **sshAuthorizedKey** | `string` | SSHAuthorizedKey is a SSH public keys that will be added to all agents for use in debugging. | N/A |
