# ManagedClusterAddOn API

## Spec Fields

spec holds configuration that could apply to any operator.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **configs** | `array` | configs is a list of add-on configurations. In scenario where the current add-on has its own configurations. An empty list means there are no default configurations for add-on. The default is an empty list | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **group** | `string` | group of the add-on configuration. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | name of the add-on configuration. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | namespace of the add-on configuration. If this field is not set, the configuration is in the cluster scope. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resource** | `string` | resource of the add-on configuration. | N/A |
|  **installNamespace** | `string` | installNamespace is the namespace on the managed cluster to install the addon agent. If it is not set, open-cluster-management-agent-addon namespace is used to install the addon agent. | `Pattern=^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$` |
## Status Fields

status holds the information about the state of an operator.  It is consistent with status information across
the Kubernetes ecosystem.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.

A csr will be created per registration configuration. If more than one registrationConfig is defined, a csr will be created for each registration configuration. It is not allowed that multiple registrationConfigs have the same signer name. After the csr is approved on the hub cluster, the klusterlet agent will create a secret in the installNamespace for the registrationConfig. If the signerName is "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client", the secret name will be "{addon name}-hub-kubeconfig" whose contents includes key/cert and kubeconfig. Otherwise, the secret name will be "{addon name}-{signer name}-client-cert" whose contents includes key/cert. | N/A |

|  **relatedObjects** | `array` | relatedObjects is a list of objects that are "interesting" or related to this operator. Common uses are: 1. the detailed resource driving the operator 2. operator namespaces 3. operand namespaces 4. related ClusterManagementAddon resource | N/A |
