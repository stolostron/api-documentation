# ClusterProvision API

ClusterProvision is the Schema for the clusterprovisions API

## Spec Fields

ClusterProvisionSpec defines the results of provisioning a cluster.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **adminKubeconfigSecretRef** | `object` | AdminKubeconfigSecretRef references the secret containing the admin kubeconfig for this cluster. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **adminPasswordSecretRef** | `object` | AdminPasswordSecretRef references the secret containing the admin username/password which can be used to login to this cluster. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **attempt** | `integer` | Attempt is which attempt number of the cluster deployment that this ClusterProvision is | N/A |
|  **clusterDeploymentRef** | `object` | ClusterDeploymentRef references the cluster deployment provisioned. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **clusterID** | `string` | ClusterID is a globally unique identifier for this cluster generated during installation. Used for reporting metrics among other places. | N/A |
|  **infraID** | `string` | InfraID is an identifier for this cluster generated during installation and used for tagging/naming resources in cloud providers. | N/A |
|  **installLog** | `string` | InstallLog is the log from the installer. | N/A |
|  **metadata** | `object` | Metadata is the metadata.json generated by the installer, providing metadata information about the cluster created. NOTE: This is not used because it didn't work (it was always empty). We think because the thing it's storing (ClusterMetadata from installer) is not a runtime.Object, so can't be put in a RawExtension. | N/A |
|  **metadataJSON** | `string` | MetadataJSON is a JSON representation of the ClusterMetadata produced by the installer. We don't use a runtime.RawExtension because ClusterMetadata isn't a runtime.Object. We don't use ClusterMetadata itself because we don't want our API consumers to need to pull in the installer code and its dependencies. | N/A |
|  **prevClusterID** | `string` | PrevClusterID is the cluster ID of the previous failed provision attempt. | N/A |
|  **prevInfraID** | `string` | PrevInfraID is the infra ID of the previous failed provision attempt. | N/A |
|  **prevProvisionName** | `string` | PrevProvisionName is the name of the previous failed provision attempt. | N/A |
|  **stage** | `string` | Stage is the stage of provisioning that the cluster deployment has reached. | N/A |
## Status Fields

ClusterProvisionStatus defines the observed state of ClusterProvision.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **conditions** | `array` | Conditions includes more detailed status for the cluster provision | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastProbeTime** | `string` | LastProbeTime is the last time we probed the condition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastTransitionTime** | `string` | LastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **message** | `string` | Message is a human-readable message indicating details about last transition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | Reason is a unique, one-word, CamelCase reason for the condition's last transition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | Status is the status of the condition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | Type is the type of the condition. | N/A |
|  **jobRef** | `object` | JobRef is the reference to the job performing the provision. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
