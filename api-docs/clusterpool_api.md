# ClusterPool API

ClusterPool represents a pool of clusters that should be kept ready to be given out to users. Clusters are removed
from the pool once claimed and then automatically replaced with a new one.

## Spec Fields

ClusterPoolSpec defines the desired state of the ClusterPool.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **annotations** | `object` | Annotations to be applied to new ClusterDeployments created for the pool. ClusterDeployments that have already been claimed will not be affected when this value is modified. | N/A |
|  **baseDomain** | `string` | BaseDomain is the base domain to use for all clusters created in this pool. | N/A |
|  **claimLifetime** | `object` | ClaimLifetime defines the lifetimes for claims for the cluster pool. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **default** | `string` | Default is the default lifetime of the claim when no lifetime is set on the claim itself. This is a Duration value; see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for accepted formats. Note: due to discrepancies in validation vs parsing, we use a Pattern instead of `Format=duration`. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050332 https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131 https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/issues/56 | `Pattern=^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+$` |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **maximum** | `string` | Maximum is the maximum lifetime of the claim after it is assigned a cluster. If the claim still exists when the lifetime has elapsed, the claim will be deleted by Hive. The lifetime of a claim is the mimimum of the lifetimes set by the cluster pool and the claim itself. This is a Duration value; see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for accepted formats. Note: due to discrepancies in validation vs parsing, we use a Pattern instead of `Format=duration`. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050332 https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131 https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/issues/56 | `Pattern=^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+$` |
|  **customizationRef** | `object` | CustomizationRef refers to a ClusterDeploymentCustomization object whose InstallerManifestPatches should be applied to *all* ClusterDeployments created by this ClusterPool. This is in addition to any CDC from Inventory. The CDC must exist in the ClusterPool's namespace. It will be copied to the namespace of each ClusterDeployment generated by the ClusterPool. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **hibernateAfter** | `string` | HibernateAfter will be applied to new ClusterDeployments created for the pool. HibernateAfter will transition clusters in the clusterpool to hibernating power state after it has been running for the given duration. The time that a cluster has been running is the time since the cluster was installed or the time since the cluster last came out of hibernation. This is a Duration value; see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for accepted formats. Note: due to discrepancies in validation vs parsing, we use a Pattern instead of `Format=duration`. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050332 https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131 https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/issues/56 | `Pattern=^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+$` |
|  **hibernationConfig** | `object` | HibernationConfig configures the hibernation/resume behavior of ClusterDeployments owned by the ClusterPool. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resumeTimeout** | `string` | ResumeTimeout is the maximum amount of time we will wait for an unclaimed ClusterDeployment to resume from hibernation (e.g. at the behest of runningCount, or in preparation for being claimed). If this time is exceeded, the ClusterDeployment will be considered Broken and we will replace it. The default (unspecified or zero) means no timeout -- we will allow the ClusterDeployment to continue trying to resume "forever". This is a Duration value; see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for accepted formats. Note: due to discrepancies in validation vs parsing, we use a Pattern instead of `Format=duration`. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050332 https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131 https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/issues/56 | `Pattern=^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+$` |
