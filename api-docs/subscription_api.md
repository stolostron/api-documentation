# Subscription API

Subscription is the Schema for the subscriptions API

## Spec Fields

SubscriptionSpec defines the desired state of Subscription

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **allow** | `array` | Specify a list of resources allowed for deployment | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | APIVersion specifies the API version for the group of resources | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kinds** | `array` | Kinds specifies a list of kinds under the same API version for the group of resources | N/A |
|  **channel** | `string` | The primary channel namespaced name used by the subscription. Its format is "<channel NameSpace>/<channel Name>" | N/A |
|  **deny** | `array` | Specify a list of resources denied for deployment | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | APIVersion specifies the API version for the group of resources | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kinds** | `array` | Kinds specifies a list of kinds under the same API version for the group of resources | N/A |
|  **hooksecretref** | `object` | Specify a secret reference used in Ansible job integration authentication | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod).
