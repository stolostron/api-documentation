# MachineDrainRule API

## Spec Fields

spec defines the spec of a MachineDrainRule.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **drain** | `object` | drain configures if and how Pods are drained. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **behavior** | `string` | behavior defines the drain behavior. Can be either "Drain", "Skip", or "WaitCompleted". "Drain" means that the Pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will be drained. If behavior is set to "Drain" the order in which Pods are drained can be configured with the order field. When draining Pods of a Node the Pods will be grouped by order and one group after another will be drained (by increasing order). Cluster API will wait until all Pods of a group are terminated / removed from the Node before starting with the next group. "Skip" means that the Pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will be skipped during drain. "WaitCompleted" means that the pods to which this MachineDrainRule applies will never be evicted and we wait for them to be completed, it is enforced that pods marked with this behavior always have Order=0. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **order** | `integer` | order defines the order in which Pods are drained. Pods with higher order are drained after Pods with lower order. order can only be set if behavior is set to "Drain". If order is not set, 0 will be used. Valid values for order are from -2147483648 to 2147483647 (inclusive). | N/A |
|  **machines** | `array` | machines defines to which Machines this MachineDrainRule should be applied. If machines is not set, the MachineDrainRule applies to all Machines in the Namespace. If machines contains multiple selectors, the results are ORed. Within a single Machine selector the results of selector and clusterSelector are ANDed. Machines will be selected from all Clusters in the Namespace unless otherwise restricted with the clusterSelector. Example: Selects control plane Machines in all Clusters or          Machines with label "os" == "linux" in Clusters with label          "stage" == "production".  - selector:      matchExpressions:      - key: cluster.x-k8s.io/control-plane        operator: Exists  - selector:      matchLabels:        os: linux    clusterSelector:      matchExpressions:      - key: stage        operator: In        values:        - production | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **clusterSelector** | `object` | clusterSelector is a label selector which selects Machines by the labels of their Clusters. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if not present or empty, it selects Machines of all Clusters. If selector is also set, then the selector as a whole selects Machines matching selector belonging to Clusters selected by clusterSelector. If selector is not set, it selects all Machines belonging to Clusters selected by clusterSelector. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchExpressions** | `array` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **key** | `string` | key is the label key that the selector applies to. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **operator** | `string` | operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **values** | `array` | values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchLabels** | `object` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **selector** | `object` | selector is a label selector which selects Machines by their labels. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if not present or empty, it selects all Machines. If clusterSelector is also set, then the selector as a whole selects Machines matching selector belonging to Clusters selected by clusterSelector. If clusterSelector is not set, it selects all Machines matching selector in all Clusters. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchExpressions** | `array` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **key** | `string` | key is the label key that the selector applies to. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **operator** | `string` | operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **values** | `array` | values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchLabels** | `object` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
|  **pods** | `array` | pods defines to which Pods this MachineDrainRule should be applied. If pods is not set, the MachineDrainRule applies to all Pods in all Namespaces. If pods contains multiple selectors, the results are ORed. Within a single Pod selector the results of selector and namespaceSelector are ANDed. Pods will be selected from all Namespaces unless otherwise restricted with the namespaceSelector. Example: Selects Pods with label "app" == "logging" in all Namespaces or          Pods with label "app" == "prometheus" in the "monitoring"          Namespace.  - selector:      matchExpressions:      - key: app        operator: In        values:        - logging  - selector:      matchLabels:        app: prometheus    namespaceSelector:      matchLabels:        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespaceSelector** | `object` | namespaceSelector is a label selector which selects Pods by the labels of their Namespaces. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if not present or empty, it selects Pods of all Namespaces. If selector is also set, then the selector as a whole selects Pods matching selector in Namespaces selected by namespaceSelector. If selector is not set, it selects all Pods in Namespaces selected by namespaceSelector. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchExpressions** | `array` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
