# HiveConfig API

HiveConfigStatus defines the observed state of Hive

## Spec Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **additionalCertificateAuthoritiesSecretRef** | `array` | AdditionalCertificateAuthoritiesSecretRef is a list of references to secrets in the TargetNamespace that contain an additional Certificate Authority to use when communicating with target clusters. These certificate authorities will be used in addition to any self-signed CA generated by each cluster on installation. The cert data should be stored in the Secret key named 'ca.crt'. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **argoCDConfig** | `object` | ArgoCD specifies configuration for ArgoCD integration. If enabled, Hive will automatically add provisioned clusters to ArgoCD, and remove them when they are deprovisioned. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **enabled** | `boolean` | Enabled dictates if ArgoCD gitops integration is enabled. If not specified, the default is disabled. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace specifies the namespace where ArgoCD is installed. Used for the location of cluster secrets. Defaults to "argocd" | N/A |
|  **awsPrivateLink** | `object` | AWSPrivateLink defines the configuration for the aws-private-link controller. It provides 3 major pieces of information required by the controller, 1. The Credentials that should be used to create AWS PrivateLink resources other than     what exist in the customer's account. 2. A list of VPCs that can be used by the controller to choose one to create AWS VPC Endpoints     for the AWS VPC Endpoint Services created for ClusterDeployments in their     corresponding regions. 3. A list of VPCs that should be able to resolve the DNS addresses setup for Private Link. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **associatedVPCs** | `array` | AssociatedVPCs is the list of VPCs that should be able to resolve the DNS addresses setup for Private Link. This allows clients in VPC to resolve the AWS PrivateLink address using AWS's default DNS resolver for Private Route53 Hosted Zones.  This list should at minimum include the VPC where the current Hive controller is running. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **credentialsSecretRef** | `object` | CredentialsSecretRef references a secret in the TargetNamespace that will be used to authenticate with AWS for associating the VPC with the Private HostedZone created for PrivateLink. When not provided, the common credentials for the controller should be used. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong.

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **endpointVPCInventory** | `array` | EndpointVPCInventory is a list of VPCs and the corresponding subnets in various AWS regions. The controller uses this list to choose a VPC for creating AWS VPC Endpoints. Since the VPC Endpoints must be in the same region as the ClusterDeployment, we must have VPCs in that region to be able to setup Private Link. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **region** | `string` | No description provided. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **minBackupPeriodSeconds** | `integer` | MinBackupPeriodSeconds specifies that a minimum of MinBackupPeriodSeconds will occur in between each backup. This is used to rate limit backups. This potentially batches together multiple changes into 1 backup. No backups will be lost as changes that happen during this interval are queued up and will result in a backup happening once the interval has been completed. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **velero** | `object` | Velero specifies configuration for the Velero backup integration. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **enabled** | `boolean` | Enabled dictates if Velero backup integration is enabled. If not specified, the default is disabled. | N/A |

The keys can be any string value suitable for a metric label (see https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels). The values can be any ClusterDeployment label key (from metadata.labels). When observing an affected metric, hive will label it with the specified metric key, and copy the value from the specified ClusterDeployment label. For example, including {"ocp_major_version": "hive.openshift.io/version-major"} will cause affected metrics to include a label key ocp_major_version with the value from the hive.openshift.io/version-major ClusterDeployment label -- e.g. "4". NOTE: Avoid ClusterDeployment labels whose values are unbounded, such as those representing cluster names or IDs, as these will cause your prometheus database to grow indefinitely. Affected metrics are those whose type implements the metricsWithDynamicLabels interface found in pkg/controller/metrics/metrics_with_dynamic_labels.go | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **metricsWithDuration** | `array` | Optional metrics and their configurations | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **duration** | `string` | Duration is the minimum time taken - the relevant metric will be logged only if the value reported by that metric is more than the time mentioned here.

Therefore you can usually set this to the config map shipped as part of OpenShift (openshift-config-managed/release-verification).  See https://github.com/openshift/cluster-update-keys for more details. The keys within the config map in the data field define how verification is performed:  verifier-public-key-*: One or more GPG public keys in ASCII form that must have signed the                        release image by digest.  store-*: A URL (scheme file://, http://, or https://) location that contains signatures. These          signatures are in the atomic container signature format. The URL will have the digest          of the image appended to it as "<STORE>/<ALGO>=<DIGEST>/signature-<NUMBER>" as described          in the container image signing format. The docker-image-manifest section of the          signature must match the release image digest. Signatures are searched starting at          NUMBER 1 and incrementing if the signature exists but is not valid. The signature is a          GPG signed and encrypted JSON message. The file store is provided for testing only at          the current time, although future versions of the CVO might allow host mounting of          signatures.  See https://github.com/containers/image/blob/ab49b0a48428c623a8f03b41b9083d48966b34a9/docs/signature-protocols.md for a description of the signature store  The returned verifier will require that any new release image will only be considered verified if each provided public key has signed the release image digest. The signature may be in any store and the lookup order is internally defined.  If not set, no verification will be performed. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the ConfigMap | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the ConfigMap | N/A |
|  **serviceProviderCredentialsConfig** | `object` | ServiceProviderCredentialsConfig is used to configure credentials related to being a service provider on various cloud platforms. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **aws** | `object` | AWS is used to configure credentials related to being a service provider on AWS. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **credentialsSecretRef** | `object` | CredentialsSecretRef references a secret in the TargetNamespace that will be used to authenticate with AWS to become the Service Provider. Being a Service Provider allows the controllers to assume the role in customer AWS accounts to manager clusters. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **syncSetReapplyInterval** | `string` | SyncSetReapplyInterval is a string duration indicating how much time must pass before SyncSet resources will be reapplied. The default reapply interval is two hours. This is a Duration value; see https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for accepted formats. Note: due to discrepancies in validation vs parsing, we use a Pattern instead of `Format=duration`. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050332 https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131 https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver/issues/56 | `Pattern=^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ns\|us\|µs\|ms\|s\|m\|h))+$` |
|  **targetNamespace** | `string` | TargetNamespace is the namespace where the core Hive components should be run. Defaults to "hive". Will be created if it does not already exist. All resource references in HiveConfig can be assumed to be in the TargetNamespace. NOTE: Whereas it is possible to edit this value, causing hive to "move" its core components to the new namespace, the old namespace is not deleted, as it will still contain resources created by kubernetes and/or other OpenShift controllers. | N/A |
## Status Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **aggregatorClientCAHash** | `string` | AggregatorClientCAHash keeps an md5 hash of the aggregator client CA configmap data from the openshift-config-managed namespace. When the configmap changes, admission is redeployed. | N/A |
|  **conditions** | `array` | Conditions includes more detailed status for the HiveConfig | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastProbeTime** | `string` | LastProbeTime is the last time we probed the condition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastTransitionTime** | `string` | LastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **message** | `string` | Message is a human-readable message indicating details about last transition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | Reason is a unique, one-word, CamelCase reason for the condition's last transition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | Status is the status of the condition. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | Type is the type of the condition. | N/A |
|  **configApplied** | `boolean` | ConfigApplied will be set by the hive operator to indicate whether or not the LastGenerationObserved was successfully reconciled. | N/A |
|  **observedGeneration** | `integer` | ObservedGeneration will record the most recently processed HiveConfig object's generation. | N/A |
