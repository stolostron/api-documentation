# ClusterPermission API

ClusterPermission is the Schema for the clusterpermissions API

## Spec Fields

ClusterPermissionSpec defines the desired state of ClusterPermission

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **clusterRole** | `object` | ClusterRole represents the ClusterRole that is being created on the managed cluster | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **rules** | `array` | Rules holds all the PolicyRules for this ClusterRole | N/A |

## Status Fields

ClusterPermissionStatus defines the observed state of ClusterPermission

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **observedGeneration** | `integer` | observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance. | `Minimum=0` |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty. | `Pattern=^[A-Za-z]([A-Za-z0-9_,:]*[A-Za-z0-9_])?$` |
