# PlacementRule API

PlacementRule is the Schema for the placementrules API

## Spec Fields

PlacementRuleSpec defines the desired state of PlacementRule

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **clusterConditions** | `array` | No description provided. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | No description provided. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | No description provided. | N/A |
|  **clusterReplicas** | `integer` | number of replicas Application wants to | N/A |
|  **clusterSelector** | `object` | A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchExpressions** | `array` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **key** | `string` | key is the label key that the selector applies to. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **operator** | `string` | operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **values** | `array` | values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **matchLabels** | `object` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. | N/A |
|  **clusters** | `array` | No description provided. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | No description provided. | N/A |
|  **policies** | `array` | Set Policy Filters | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **apiVersion** | `string` | API version of the referent. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **fieldPath** | `string` | If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **kind** | `string` | Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/ | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resourceVersion** | `string` | Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **uid** | `string` | UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids | N/A |
|  **resourceHint** | `object` | Select Resource | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **order** | `string` | SelectionOrder is the type for Nodes | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | ResourceType defines types can be sorted | N/A |
|  **schedulerName** | `string` | INSERT ADDITIONAL SPEC FIELDS - desired state of cluster Important: Run "make" to regenerate code after modifying this file schedulerName, default to use mcm controller | N/A |
## Status Fields
