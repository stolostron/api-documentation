# ManagedClusterAction API

ManagedClusterAction is the action that will be done on a cluster

## Spec Fields

Spec defines the desired behavior of the action.

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **actionType** | `string` | ActionType is the type of the action | N/A |
|  **kube** | `object` | KubeWorkSpec is the action payload to process | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the object | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **namespace** | `string` | Namespace of the object | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **resource** | `string` | Resource of the object | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **template** | `object` | ObjectTemplate is the template of the object | N/A |
## Status Fields

Status describes the desired status of the action

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **conditions** | `array` | Conditions represents the conditions of this resource on managed cluster | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **lastTransitionTime** | `string` | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **message** | `string` | message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **observedGeneration** | `integer` | observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance. | `Minimum=0` |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty. | `Pattern=^[A-Za-z]([A-Za-z0-9_,:]*[A-Za-z0-9_])?$` |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **status** | `string` | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown. | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt) | `Pattern=^([a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*/)?(([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9])$` |
|  **result** | `object` | Result references the related result of the action | N/A |
