# ManifestWorkReplicaSet API

ManifestWorkReplicaSet is the Schema for the ManifestWorkReplicaSet API. This custom resource is able to apply
ManifestWork using Placement for 0..n ManagedCluster(in their namespaces). It will also remove the ManifestWork custom resources
when deleted. Lastly the specific ManifestWork custom resources created per ManagedCluster namespace will be adjusted based on PlacementDecision
changes.
