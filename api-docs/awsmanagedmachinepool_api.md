| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **reason** | `string` | The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase. The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API. This field may be empty. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **type** | `string` | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.

|  **failureMessage** | `string` | FailureMessage will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the MachinePool and will contain a more verbose string suitable for logging and human consumption. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachinePool's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of MachinePools can be added as events to the MachinePool object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
|  **failureReason** | `string` | FailureReason will be set in the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the MachinePool and will contain a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation. This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured. Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of MachinePools can be added as events to the MachinePool object and/or logged in the controller's output. | N/A |
