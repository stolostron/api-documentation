## Spec Fields

DNSZoneSpec defines the desired state of DNSZone

| Field | Type | Description | Validations |
|:---|---|---|---|
|  **aws** | `object` | AWS specifies AWS-specific cloud configuration | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **additionalTags** | `array` | AdditionalTags is a set of additional tags to set on the DNS hosted zone. In addition to these tags,the DNS Zone controller will set a hive.openhsift.io/hostedzone tag identifying the HostedZone record that it belongs to. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **credentialsAssumeRole** | `object` | CredentialsAssumeRole refers to the IAM role that must be assumed to obtain AWS account access for the DNS CRUD operations. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **externalID** | `string` | ExternalID is random string generated by platform so that assume role is protected from confused deputy problem. more info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html | N/A |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **region** | `string` | Region is the AWS region to use for route53 operations. This defaults to us-east-1. For AWS China, use cn-northwest-1. | N/A |

| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **cloudName** | `string` | CloudName is the name of the Azure cloud environment which can be used to configure the Azure SDK with the appropriate Azure API endpoints. If empty, the value is equal to "AzurePublicCloud". | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **credentialsSecretRef** | `object` | CredentialsSecretRef references a secret that will be used to authenticate with Azure CloudDNS. It will need permission to create and manage CloudDNS Hosted Zones. Secret should have a key named 'osServicePrincipal.json'. The credentials must specify the project to use. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |

|  **gcp** | `object` | GCP specifies GCP-specific cloud configuration | N/A |
| └>&nbsp;&nbsp; **credentialsSecretRef** | `object` | CredentialsSecretRef references a secret that will be used to authenticate with GCP CloudDNS. It will need permission to create and manage CloudDNS Hosted Zones. Secret should have a key named 'osServiceAccount.json'. The credentials must specify the project to use. | N/A |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└>&nbsp;&nbsp; **name** | `string` | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | N/A |
|  **linkToParentDomain** | `boolean` | LinkToParentDomain specifies whether DNS records should be automatically created to link this DNSZone with a parent domain. | N/A |
|  **preserveOnDelete** | `boolean` | PreserveOnDelete allows the user to disconnect a DNSZone from Hive without deprovisioning it. This can also be used to abandon ongoing DNSZone deprovision. Typically set automatically due to PreserveOnDelete being set on a ClusterDeployment. | N/A |
|  **zone** | `string` | Zone is the DNS zone to host | N/A |
