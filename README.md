# Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) API Documentation

Welcome to the API documentation repository for **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM)**. This repository provides detailed documentation for the core and extended APIs that power ACM and its ecosystem.

## Overview

Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) enables you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, including OpenShift and other Kubernetes distributions, from a single control plane. ACM provides capabilities for cluster lifecycle management, application lifecycle, governance, risk, compliance, storage, container native virtualization, networking and edge management as well as observability across clusters.

This repository contains:
- **Custom Resource Definition (CRDs) API documentation** for ACM core components
- Links to API documentation for ACM add-ons and related open source projects

## Core API Documentation

The core API documentation, including all ACM CRDs and their detailed specifications, can be found in the [api-docs/README.md](./api-docs/README.md).

* [Release-2.14](https://github.com/stolostron/api-documentation/blob/release-2.14/api-docs/README.md)
* [PRE-Release-2.15](https://github.com/stolostron/api-documentation/blob/release-2.15/api-docs/README.md)

## External ACM-Related API Documentation

ACM integrates with and extends many open source projects. Below are links to API documentation for key external components and add-ons commonly used with ACM:

- **[Gatekeeper (OPA)](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/)
  - Policy and governance for Kubernetes clusters.
- **[VolSync](https://backube.github.io/volsync/)
  - Asynchronous data replication for Kubernetes volumes, used for backup and disaster recovery in ACM-managed clusters.
- **[Submariner](https://submariner.io/docs/)
  - Enables direct networking between pods and services in different Kubernetes clusters.
- **[Open Cluster Management (OCM) APIs](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/concepts/architecture/)
  - The upstream open source project powering ACM.
- **[Cluster Lifecycle API (stolostron/cluster-lifecycle-api)](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-lifecycle-api)
  - Types and concepts for cluster lifecycle management in ACM and MCE.
- **[Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
  - Next-generation service networking APIs, often used with ACM for advanced traffic management.

## Running make gen-api-docs-core

To generate API documentation for the core ACM product (including multiclusterhub-operator, backplane-operator, and OCM), you can use the `gen-api-docs-core` target:

```sh
# Generate API docs for the core product using default branches (main)
make gen-api-docs-core

# Or specify specific release branches
RELEASE_BRANCH=release-2.15.0 BACKPLANE_BRANCH=backplane-2.10.0 make gen-api-docs-core
```

This command will:
1. Clone the required repositories (multiclusterhub-operator, backplane-operator, ocm)
2. Extract CRDs from the cloned repositories
3. Generate API documentation from the CRDs
4. Clean up the cloned repositories

## Branching for a Release

To create a release branch and ensure the GitHub Action workflow uses the correct branches for external dependencies:

1. **Create a Release Branch:**
   - From your main branch, create a new branch for the release. For example:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b release-2.14
     git push origin release-2.14
     ```

2. **Update the GitHub Action Workflow:**
   - Edit `.github/workflows/generate-api-docs.yml` to set the correct default branch for cloning external repositories.
   - If your release branch is `release-2.14`, ensure the workflow or Makefile logic sets:
     - `CLONE_BRANCH=release-2.14` for `multiclusterhub-operator`
     - `backplane-2.9` for `backplane-operator` (where `2.9` is derived from the release as described in the Makefile logic)

3. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Commit your workflow achanges to the release branch:
     ```sh
     git add .github/workflows/generate-api-docs.yml Makefile
     git commit -m "Update workflow for release-2.14"
     git push origin release-2.14
     ```

4. **Run the GitHub Action:**
   - Trigger the workflow from the Actions tab, ensuring it runs on your release branch.

Refer to the Makefile and workflow comments for more details on how the correct branches are selected.
